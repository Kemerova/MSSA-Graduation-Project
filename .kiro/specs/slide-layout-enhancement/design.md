# Design Document: Slide Layout Enhancement

## Overview

This design document outlines the approach for enhancing the layout and visual organization of the presentation slides in the "Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Servers" web-based project. The goal is to create a balanced, readable, and space-efficient layout that effectively utilizes the available viewport while maintaining a professional and engaging appearance.

## Architecture

The enhanced slide layout will use a combination of CSS Grid and Flexbox for positioning and responsive behavior. The architecture will follow these principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep structure (HTML), presentation (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript) separate
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Ensure basic functionality works without JavaScript, then enhance with JS for animations and interactions
3. **Responsive Design**: Use fluid layouts and media queries to adapt to different screen sizes
4. **Accessibility**: Maintain proper semantic structure and ARIA attributes for screen readers

## Components and Interfaces

### Main Layout Structure

The main slide layout will consist of the following components:

1. **Header Section** (unchanged)
   - Logo and title
   - Program information

2. **Progress Bar Section** (unchanged)
   - Progress indicator
   - Slide counter

3. **Slideshow Container** (enhanced)
   - Three-column grid layout for slide content
   - Responsive behavior for different screen sizes

4. **Controls Section** (unchanged)
   - Navigation buttons
   - Speed controls

### Slide Content Layout

The slide content will be organized in a three-column grid layout:

```
+-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
|                   |                   |                   |
|                   |                   |                   |
|   Slide Image     |   Text Content    |      Logo         |
|     (40%)         |      (40%)        |      (20%)        |
|                   |                   |                   |
|                   |                   |                   |
+-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
```

## Data Models

No new data models are required for this enhancement. The existing slide data structure will be maintained:

```javascript
const slideData = [
    {
        week: 1,
        weekRange: "Introduction",
        title: "Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Servers: A MSSA Odyssey",
        content: "...",
        image: "images/1.png",
        imagePlaceholder: "..."
    },
    // Additional slides...
];
```

|  |             |  |                |  |                   |   |

|  +-------------+  +----------------+  +-------------------+   |
|                                                               |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|                      Controls                                 |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Responsive Behavior

#### Desktop (>= 1200px)
- Three-column layout as described above
- Full-width container (max-width: 1600px)
- Proportional spacing between elements

#### Tablet (768px - 1199px)
- Three-column layout maintained
- Reduced padding and margins
- Slightly smaller font sizes

#### Mobile (< 768px)
- Stack elements vertically
- Order: Image, Text, Logo
- Full-width elements with appropriate padding
- Adjusted font sizes for readability

### Color Scheme and Typography

The existing color scheme and typography will be maintained for consistency:

- Primary color: `#2D5016` (dark green)
- Secondary color: `#4A7C59` (medium green)
- Accent color: `#FFD700` (gold)
- Background color: `#F8FAFC` (light gray)
- Text color: `#1F2937` (dark gray)

Typography:
- Font family: 'Inter', sans-serif
- Headings: 700 weight (bold)
- Body text: 400 weight (regular)

## Error Handling

1. **Image Loading Errors**: If a slide image fails to load, display a placeholder with appropriate alt text
2. **Logo Loading Errors**: If a logo fails to load, hide the logo container to maintain layout balance
3. **Overflow Content**: If text content exceeds the container height, enable smooth scrolling

## Testing Strategy

1. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
2. **Responsive Testing**: Test on various screen sizes using browser dev tools
3. **Performance Testing**: Ensure smooth animations and transitions
4. **Accessibility Testing**: Verify proper semantic structure and screen reader compatibility

### Test Cases

1. Verify layout proportions on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens
2. Test text scrolling behavior for long content
3. Verify image and logo loading and error handling
4. Test slide transitions and logo updates
5. Verify responsive behavior during window resizing

## Implementation Considerations

1. **CSS Grid vs. Flexbox**: Use CSS Grid for the main layout structure and Flexbox for alignment within containers
2. **Image Optimization**: Ensure images are properly optimized for web display
3. **Performance**: Minimize layout shifts during page load and slide transitions
4. **Accessibility**: Maintain proper semantic structure and ARIA attributes

## Design Decisions and Rationales

1. **Three-Column Layout**: Chosen to create a balanced visual hierarchy and make effective use of horizontal space
2. **40-40-20 Distribution**: Allocates appropriate space for each element based on its importance and content requirements
3. **Responsive Breakpoints**: Selected based on common device sizes and content readability requirements
4. **Maintaining Existing Color Scheme**: Ensures consistency with the overall project design language
