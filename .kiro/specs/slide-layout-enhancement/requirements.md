# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the layout and visual organization of the existing presentation slides in the "Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Servers" web-based project for the Microsoft Software & Systems Academy (MSSA). The current layout has issues with element sizing, spacing, and overall visual balance that need to be addressed to create a more professional and engaging user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an MSSA program participant, I want a well-organized slide layout so that I can easily consume the content without visual distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any slide THEN the user SHALL see three main elements arranged horizontally: slide image, text content, and logo
2. WHEN viewing the slide on desktop or tablet devices THEN the layout SHALL utilize the full viewport width effectively
3. WHEN viewing the slide THEN the header and progress bar SHALL remain unchanged at the top of the page
4. WHEN viewing the slide THEN the user SHALL NOT see any oversized or unwanted elements dominating the space

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an MSSA program participant, I want the slide image to be properly sized and positioned so that I can clearly see the visual content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any slide THEN the slide image SHALL occupy approximately 40% of the available horizontal space
2. WHEN viewing any slide THEN the slide image SHALL be centered within its container
3. WHEN viewing any slide THEN the slide image SHALL maintain its aspect ratio without distortion
4. WHEN hovering over the slide image THEN the image SHALL have a subtle visual effect to enhance engagement

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an MSSA program participant, I want the text content to be readable and well-formatted so that I can easily understand the information being presented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any slide THEN the text content SHALL occupy approximately 40% of the available horizontal space
2. WHEN viewing any slide THEN the text content SHALL have appropriate font size, line height, and spacing for optimal readability
3. WHEN the text content exceeds the visible area THEN it SHALL scroll smoothly within its container
4. WHEN the text content scrolls THEN it SHALL do so at a readable pace

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an MSSA program participant, I want the logo to be appropriately sized and positioned so that it enhances the slide without dominating it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any slide THEN the logo SHALL occupy approximately 20% of the available horizontal space
2. WHEN viewing any slide THEN the logo SHALL be centered within its container
3. WHEN viewing any slide THEN the logo SHALL be clearly visible but not dominate the slide
4. WHEN transitioning between slides THEN the logo SHALL update to match the current slide content if applicable

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an MSSA program participant, I want the slide layout to be responsive so that it looks good on different screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing slides on different screen sizes THEN the layout SHALL adapt proportionally
2. WHEN the screen width decreases below a certain threshold THEN the layout SHALL reorganize to maintain readability
3. WHEN viewing on smaller screens THEN critical content SHALL remain visible and accessible
4. WHEN the layout adapts to different screen sizes THEN the visual hierarchy and content relationships SHALL be maintained
5. WHEN the window is resized THEN the layout SHALL adjust smoothly without breaking
